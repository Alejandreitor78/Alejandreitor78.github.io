The first two days went pretty well, besides the fact that the only thing we could eat were broccoli and tomatoes. On day three Fluffy got eaten by a shark on our way down to our hotel.

                <li><i>?</i> out of <i>?</i> stars: "I went broke because I bought the tickets on a Saturday Holiday, so I couldn't afford to sleep in the ocean of death for more than one day. While staying at the ocean hotel, I saw a wet cat being eaten by sharks. It was awesome, man. I slept in the garbage disposal chute for the rest of the trip and it was pretty good because I got free rotten tomatoes thrown down every once in a while. It was great until this woman dropped her camera into the disposal chute and it landed on my head. I got knocked out for a day and then I remembered I didn't have enough money for the plane ride home. I then sold the expensive camera that knocked me out and got enough money for half of the plane ride home, but no fatal coincidences happened. I then found a sorta alive goldfish in the garbage and dropped it into the Volcano of Death. Then I filed a report that said someone died on my trip, and got the ride home half off! The trip really is great if you want to scam the trip providers!

We visited the Ocean of Death first it was cool, my older brother who is ALWAYS picking on me got his leg bit off by a shark it was hilarious my parents then took us to get some food. I got some broccoli because even if I prefer it boiled cold broccoli is fine. My sister ordered berries and got food poisoning, I warned her! It did say poisonous but she didn't listen. She's in the hospital right now. We finally got to go the Volcano of Death! I was so excited but my dad leaned a little to close over the volcano and fell in. I watched him melt. It was cool. We had to go home after that because we didn't have any more money to buy another night. Atleast that's what my mom says. Best. Birthday. EVER!

                <i>3</i> out of <i>5</i> stars: "I'd been intending to go to the Land of Joy, but I misread the brochure and ended up in the Land of Doom. After losing all my money to the kind agents (I think they might be keeping some of it for themselves, you know) I went to that Volcano of Death. I saw a few people fall into it (ouch), and decided that I probably shouldn't stay there after some little kid went up behind me and attempted to push me in. After I managed to flee with only one less arm (darned security guards), I skipped the desert place and headed to the Tallest Mountain. I had no money left, so I couldn't actually get into the hotel place. Anyway, while I was sleeping on the edge of one of the sheer cliffs that dot the mountain's surface, that same kid from the volcano snuck up and pushed me off -- however, I was saved by a conveniently-placed rock. After breaking almost all of my bones (don't worry, the fall missed the ones in my arm; that is, the one the security guard got), I stumbled to the ocean. Once there, I was snagged by a creature and pulled into the depths. Only then did I realize it was that one kid again. I managed to escape his groping paws, and immediately fled. When I finally reached the lobby after days of running, I purchased an expensive camera from someone selling it. Although there were signs of trash on it, it made the entire trip worthwhile ... until, of course, I found that I was sitting right next to that kid on the flight back. And, well ... I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon. Plus, I want my money back!"<br><br>- Captain Argon

They push people into the Ocean of Death for no extra charge if you ask them to! :D
Well worth the price.

I stayed Below the Volcano of Death for my first night, and I got a free light show when a chunk of the wall came off!

                <i>5</i> out of <i>5</i> stars: "When I was just a little tadpole me and my mommy went to the volcano of doom. It was awesome! We stayed for 7 months because the staff illegally forced us to! Man, I tell you, it was like heaven! First, we went to their gourmet cafe and ordered their moldiest broccoli. It was so good, we ordered a second one! By the fifth serving, we were full so we walked out up to the mountain. But then, the volcano erupted again and it burnt up all of our moldy broccoli! It also gave my mommy a full-body fourth degree burn. She decided to eat some mushrooms but got sick and then threw up a bucketload of broccoli. She went back to our hotel room, and she told me to go climb the giant mountain, when it started to rain. But, as everyone knows, rain by a volcano is actually lava. So while I ran up the mountain, getting lava splotches all over my cheap quality gift-shop shirt. I ran screaming up to the top of the mountain, which was where I found a big wolf, staring back at me! I yelled for help, but then I started falling backwards, tumbling head over heels. Before I knew it, I was plummeting into the world's Iciest Water That Wasn't Frozen. After that, a shark bit my leg off. I hopped to shore, yelling for help when I found my mommy, isolating herself in the hotel room. After that, I left. Besides the lava rain, the missing leg, the poisonous food, the cold water, the hot volcano, the tiny hotel room, the bad room service, and the cheap quality gift-shop, it was a great experience! I hope we can go there again next year!"<br><br>- SP

We(I and my brother),
stayed at the "The Tallest Mountain",
That was the bigest mistake of my life though,
(I'm afraid of hights,T-T ) It was horrible!
For the last two days we staid at
"the vast and dry desert",
WITH NO WATER (HORRIBLE) but,it wasn't so bad, besides the part were I got 100 cactus needles in my leg.
Reveiw on "Tickets":
This cost me a whopping of,$2,500.00!
I went on a Saturday,also a holiday!(So EXPENSIVE!),that I did not like, but everything else was neat-o!(I also loved the custermer serice...Oh, that was so nice).

we stayed for week in total.

                <i>?</i> out of <i>5</i> stars: "It was the best day ever.
I first visited the Volcano of Death. It was an extraordinary sight. I thought I saw something glowing under the volcano, and I almost fell inside before some kind of mythical spirit grabbed me.
I loved the berries and mushrooms the most. It was the best food I have ever eaten. It made me feel a bit funny, but it was a good kind of "funny".
Then we visited the Vast and Dry Desert. The wind blew a giant wave of flying sand in my face and pushed me away. I got about two hundred cactus needles in my leg, but I didn't care. I flew closer and closer to the Tallest Mountain, until I finally hit it and caused an avalanche. Miraculously, I was able to climb up against the falling snow until I reached the top of the mountain.
Then came the absolute worst part of my trip to the Land of Doom. I saw a mountain wolf looking directly at me. It looked really sad and hungry. Probably because other visitors that came before me misunderstood it and recklessly chased it around with their nasty weapons. I wasn't going to be like those other visitors.

I was never heard of ever since.

Then I got reborn as a shark in the Ocean of Death. YAAAAAAY! Now I could do whatever I wanted. A bunch of people swam over to me, but I played around with them and chased them away. They deserved it xD. I'll never forget the looks on their faces.
I stayed at the Ocean of Death for my whole life. Except when I migrated to other places. They tried to make me pay for the ride away, but it's not like they could have stopped me.
I was looking up from the Ocean one day to see what was happening above. The best part was when I saw someone get hit in the head by a camera.
I'm satisfied with my trip!

Was I the one involved in the cat incident? Hmm... Maybe, maybe not.

I'm going to change my name to Shark for a day. xD"<br><br>- Shark (Platinum Programming)

                <i>1000</i> out of <i>10</i> stars: "This place was excruciatingly horrible. I almost died 625 times, and when I tried to ride on top of bob (I named a shark), he looked at me funny. HOW COULD HE? HE WAS MY FAVORITE SHARK. HOW CAN YOU CALL A PLACE GOOD WHEN A SHARK FROM THAT PLACE LOOKS AT YOU FUNNY? Well, you can call it good if it has wi-fi. Or if you brought your own router (which I did), but at least I could play my phone. It was an amazing experience. I am now prepared for the real world."<br><br>- nanoscopic

particular quite dangerous,you can generaly avoid them. the main drawback is that the local animals were not trained as shown in the brochure, so many were actually friendly, which was confusing for a while.."<br><br>- screenslaver

                <i>4</i> out of <i>5</i> stars: "I only rated it 4/5 stars because although we had an amazing time Jimmy fell into the Volcano of Death (We might have pushed him in), and we never saw him again. Although that was just a tiny complaint, my major complaint is that the restaurants didn't have any bathrooms, so we had to pee in the ocean of death, unfortunately (Not really) Billy fell into it. I loved the educational aspect of it, considering I was educated how nice it is to live without your kids."<br><br>- Mrs. redeyewhiskey
